# Refactoring for Cleanliness

- find commenting extension

## Lessons:

- Still need to pass in tokens for endpoints to work.

## Where I left off:

NEXT STEPS: Clean/redo MyShelf

- add nested routes
- take off extra dependencies

BUG: None!

LAST SUCCESS: rebuilt the header and it looks beautiful

- **For every directory:**

- Move applicable functions to nearest parent container component

- Add semantic HTML tags

- Remove superfluous HTML tags

- Rename directories, files, and functions to match purpose

- Get data to flow from parent container to child component where possible

- Test

Cleaned Directories:
if sub directories and files are not listed, they are all complete

- /Account

- /AddBook

- /Auth
