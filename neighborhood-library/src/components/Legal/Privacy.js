      <h2>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h2>
      <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
      <p>
        Neighborhood Library is located exclusively online and managed remotely.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is Neighborhood Library's policy to respect your privacy regarding
        any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
        Policy applies to{" "}
        <a href="https://goofy-mayer-45bb20.netlify.com/">
          https://goofy-mayer-45bb20.netlify.com/
        </a>{" "}
        (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://goofy-mayer-45bb20.netlify.com/").
        We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally
        identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have
        adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what
        information may be collected on our Website, how we use this
        information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the
        information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
        information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our
        collection of information from other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on
        our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use
        of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website,
        you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        Like most website operators, Neighborhood Library collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. Neighborhood Library's purpose in collecting non-personally
        identifying information is to better understand how Neighborhood
        Library's visitors use its website. From time to time, Neighborhood
        Library may release non-personally-identifying information in the
        aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
        website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neighborhood Library also collects potentially personally-identifying
        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users
        and for users leaving comments on
        https://goofy-mayer-45bb20.netlify.com/ blog posts. Neighborhood Library
        only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
        information as described below.
      </p>
      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>
        Certain visitors to Neighborhood Library's websites choose to interact
        with Neighborhood Library in ways that require Neighborhood Library to
        gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
        information that Neighborhood Library gathers depends on the nature of
        the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
        https://goofy-mayer-45bb20.netlify.com/ to provide a username and email
        address.
      </p>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
        remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>
      <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
      <p>
        Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by
        us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that
        third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
        and terms and conditions of every site you visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content,
        privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or
        services.
      </p>
      <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>
        Neighborhood Library discloses potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
        contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
        information in order to process it on Neighborhood Library's behalf or
        to provide services available at Neighborhood Library's website, and
        (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
        employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
        outside of your home country; by using Neighborhood Library's website,
        you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Neighborhood
        Library will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
        employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above,
        Neighborhood Library discloses potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
        order or other governmental request, or when Neighborhood Library
        believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
        protect the property or rights of Neighborhood Library, third parties or
        the public at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a registered user of https://goofy-mayer-45bb20.netlify.com/
        and have supplied your email address, Neighborhood Library may
        occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit
        your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with
        Neighborhood Library and our products. We primarily use our blog to
        communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of
        email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support
        email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to
        publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to
        help us support other users. Neighborhood Library takes all measures
        reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
        alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
      <p>
        Although most changes are likely to be minor, Neighborhood Library may
        change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Neighborhood
        Library's sole discretion. Neighborhood Library encourages visitors to
        frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your
        continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will
        constitute your acceptance of such change.
